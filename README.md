# ComposeLife

**This is not an official Google product**

ComposeLife is a
work-in-progress [Game of Life][wikipedia_gameoflife] simulator
multiplatform app.

This project is a personal sandbox of sorts, experimenting with the latest libraries and tools.
These include:

- Written in [Kotlin][kotlin]
- UI written in [Jetpack Compose][jetpack_compose]
  - Mobile Android app and desktop app for exploring Game of Life patterns.
  - Watchface for Wear OS with configuration
  - Custom [adaptive navigation library][navigation]
- [Dependency injection][dependency-injection] using [Metro][metro] and
  [context parameters][context_parameters]
- [AGSL][agsl], [OpenGL](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/graphics/opengl/about-opengl) and [SKSL][sksl] rendering
- Fully functional CI system with GitHub Actions with:
    - Comprehensive automated tests
      - Hierarchical KMP tests shared across platforms
      - Shared [Robolectric][robolectric] and instrumentation tests
      - Minified instrumentation tests with the help of [Keeper][keeper], memory leak checking with
        [LeakCanary][leakcanary])
      - Screenshot tests with [Roborazzi][roborazzi] with automatic updates on CI
      - Code coverage with [JaCoCo][jacoco] (reporting done with [Codecov][codecov])
    - Linting, with android/lint and [detekt][detekt] with automatic updates on CI
    - Automatic dependency updates with [Renovate][renovate]
    - Automatic [baseline profile][baseline_profiles] generation

## Setup

Requirements:
- Android Studio Narwhal 3 Feature Drop 2025.1.3
- JDK 21+

Clone the project, and build! (no API keys or other setup necessary)

## Runnable Modules

[app][app] contains the mobile app simulator for running, editing, and exploring Game of Life
patterns.

[desktop-app][desktop-app] contains the desktop app simulator for running, editing, and exploring Game of Life
patterns.

[wear][wear] contains a Game of Life watchface, with a stable pattern displaying the time with a
surrounding random soup potentially destroying it while the watchface is active.
