# Module: geometry

This is a Kotlin Multiplatform library module that contains geometry-related utility classes and functions.

## Purpose & Architecture

- This module provides data structures and functions for working with geometric concepts like points, rectangles,
  and other shapes.
- It is built on top of Jetpack Compose's `ui-geometry` and `ui-unit` artifacts, and provides a common abstraction
  for use in other modules.

## Usage

- Use the classes and functions in this module when you need to perform geometric calculations or represent
  geometric objects in a platform-agnostic way.
