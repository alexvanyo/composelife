# Directory: kotlin-js-store

This directory is related to the Kotlin/Wasm target of the project.

## Purpose & Architecture

- This directory contains a `wasm` subdirectory, which in turn holds a `yarn.lock` file.
- This indicates that this directory is used to pin JavaScript dependencies via `yarn` for the WebAssembly target.
