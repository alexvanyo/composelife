# Module: app

This module is the primary entry point for the **Android mobile application**.

## Purpose & Architecture

- This module assembles the shared library modules (like `algorithm`, `data`, `ui-mobile`, etc.) into a runnable Android application.
- It is responsible for defining Android-specific components like the main `Activity` and handling application lifecycle.
- It contains the necessary setup for the Android application, including the `AndroidManifest.xml`.

## Build Variants

- Note the presence of a `staging` build variant (`src/androidStaging`), which may have different configurations or features than the `release` build.

## Performance

- This application uses Baseline Profiles to improve performance. The profiles are generated by the `:app-baseline-profile-generator` module. When making significant UI changes, the baseline profile may need to be regenerated.
